# HomesApp
Angular app: building the Homes rental housing finder from the Angular tutorial.

During development, this app is using JSON Server to access a hardcoded array of housing locations from db.json instead of fetching data from an external API or database.  

When testing the app, run this command in a split terminal to access the housing location data: json-server --watch db.json
